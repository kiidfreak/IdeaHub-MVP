# Missing Backend Endpoints 

- get-requests
- reject-requests
- leave-group

# Ideas tab checklist

## DONE

- IDEA CREATION

- IDEA VIEWING

- FIXED FIGURE OR NUMBER OF WORDS FOR TITLE AND DESCRIPTION - DONE

- REMOVE IDEA COMMENTS

## TO BE DONE

- HAVE THE SHARE IDEA AS A POPUP MODAL NOT AN INLINE THING

- IDEA DATE FIX

- IDEA DELETION 

- IDEA OPENING AND VIEWING - popup

- Increase margins for Idea page too

- REMOVE THE ANONYMOUS LOGO - ITS REPETITIVE 

**Considerations for the Idea opening and viewing popup**

OR INSTEAD OF A POPUP HAVE THE PAGE DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS: MEMBERS ON THEFAR LEFT (COLLAPSIBLE), IN THE MIDDLE IDEAS, IN THE FAR LET WHEN A USER CLICKS ON AN IDEA IT JUST DISPLAYS THAT IDEA IN THIS FAR LEFT SECTION

THINK OF A WAY THAT DOES NOT HAVE A POPUP, HAVING A POPUP SOUNDS TOO EXHAUSTING TO THE USER CLICK IDEA VIEW CLOSE CLICK ANOTHER ONE CLOSE YEAH I DONT WANT THAT 

## NICE TO HAVE

- IDEA DISPLAY UI - SORT OF LIKE A STICKY NOTE SITUATION - YEAH SOMETHING RETRO - THINK ABOUT IT - INSTEAD OF GENERIC CARD STACKING

- POSSIBLY HAVE A COMMENT SECTION

# Groups tab checklist

## DONE
- Create group

- View and display groups

- FIXED NUMBER OF WORDS FOR TITLE AND DESCRIPTION

- HAVE A READMORE BUTTON OR LIMIT THE CHARS COMPLETELY TO AVOID OVERFLOW OF DESCRIPTION 

- FETCH THE COUNT NO OF IDEAS AND DISPLAY THEM ON THE GROUPS LANDING PAGE


## TO BE DONE 
- Increase margins

- Remove list view

- Leave group endpoint 

- VIEW REQUESTS ENDPOINT

- REJECT REQUESTS ENDPOINT

- NOTIFICATIONS TAB TIES TO THE ABOVE ENDPOINTS

- BETTER UI

- PLACE THAT DELETE ICON OR BUTTON SOMEWHERE BETTER - ALSO CHANGE HOW IT LOOKS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD

- Edit that out ? logo - have something else in place maybe an avatar or think of something

- Have it as either member or admin tag (remove the "you are")

- Remove the config button in the group component html page 

## NICE TO HAVE

- EDIT GROUP NAME button probably

- POSSIBLY HAVE CATEGORIES TO AVOID SO MUCH CLUTTER FROM ALL SORTS OF GROUPS WITH THE FORMATION OF GROUPS - how can we categorize the groups

- HAVE FILTERS - MAYBE LIKE A DATE FILTER

- MAYBE HAVE A SEARCH BAR

# CONSIDERATION

SHORTENING THE LINES OF CODE IN THE CSS FILES MAINLY - ALSO LOOK AT THE GROUP COMPONENT TS FILE AND THE ROLE FETCHING HAPPENING IN THE AUTH SERVICE TS FILE
